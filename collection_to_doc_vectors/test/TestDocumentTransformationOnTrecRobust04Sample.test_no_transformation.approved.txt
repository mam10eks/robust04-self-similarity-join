MARPLES (ST. MARTIN'S\nPRESS: $35, CLOTH; $14.95, PAPER; 316 PP., ILLUSTRATED; 0-312-02432-0)\n</P>\n</HEADLINE>\n<TEXT>\n<P>\nThe onset of the new Gorbachev policy of glasnost, commonly mistranslated as\nopenness but closer in connotation to candor or publicizing, has complicated\nthe task of Soviet secret-keepers and has allowed substantial new Western\ninsights into Soviet society. David R. Marples' new book, his second on the\nChernobyl accident of April 26, 1986, is a shining example of the best type of\nnon-Soviet analysis into topics that only recently were absolutely taboo in\nMoscow official circles.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe author, a British-educated historian and economist, is a research associate\nwith the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies at the University of Alberta,\nand the academic style of the book is undisguised. However, its intended\naudience is the general public, and anyone interested in nuclear power, or\nSoviet economy and society, or human drama, or just plain sleuthing state\nsecrets, will find hitherto unpublished revelations and explanations of the\nevent and its continuing aftermath.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe effects of Chernobyl reverberated throughout so many facets of Soviet\nsociety that a continuous coherent narrative is probably impossible. Marples\ndiscusses half a dozen major themes arranged in a fairly arbitrary order (as\nindicated by the frequent and helpful cross references throughout the text) and\nsucceeds in mapping out his main themes. The personal interests of each reader\ndetermine which of the sections may be deemed too detailed and which too\nsketchy, but considering the need for such a comprehensive overview, the levels\nare generally appropriate.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe book is, on the one hand, not a light read, and an executive summary might\nhave been possible in a quarter the length. But, on the other, so many of the\njudgments depend on a subtle interpretation of a multitude of sources that the\nauthor is obligated to present the raw data for the reader's inspection. The\nmodular nature of the book also allows a reader to skip, browse, and revisit\nearlier sections, aided by a convenient internal organization and a thorough\nindex.\n</P>\n<P>\nFirst in the world's attention, and in the text, is a discussion of the human\nvictims of the accident. The official tally is 31 (only about 20 names have\never been released), but Marples suspects there were other short-term radiation\nvictims. A large number of unnecessary late-term abortions were also performed\non local women, and by rights those unborn babies count as casualties.\nWidespread \"radiophobia\" led to restricted diets which created malnourishment\nand subsequent disease in thousands of people. The tens of thousands of people\ntaking part in cleanup operations were never included in official totals of\nthose exposed. Since the book went to press, Soviet military sources have\nreferred to at least one death in the actual reactor entombment program.\n</P>\n<P>\nBut the greatest toll is likely to occur with the delayed deaths. Here, Marples\nencounters for the first time the soon familiar theme of official Soviet\nmyth-making around the event: Reality is twisted to serve state policy\nobjectives, which include calming an alarmed public with assurances that all is\nwell when it isn't.\n</P>\n<P>\nAnd thus is born what he properly labels the \"myth of Chernobyl,\" the official\nline that the disaster provided a test that Soviet society passed with honor.\n\"In the Soviet view,\" he writes, \"it was first and foremost a victory, a story\nwith an ending, and an ending that was triumphant.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nThus, when sober Western medical estimates placed the future \"excess cancer\ndeaths\" at several tens of thousands, both in the Soviet Union and in Europe (a\nfew tenths of a percent elevation of the natural cancer rate), the Soviets\nreacted furiously. The estimates are branded \"nonsense\" and the estimators are\ndismissed as \"panic mongers\" promulgating \"anti-Soviet venom.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nSubsequently the author addresses themes of environmental impact, economic and\npolitical repercussions, public images, and the recovery operations. Along the\nway, Marples provides a damning list of examples in which Soviet officials\nattempted to retreat behind old-style cover-ups and outright lies. False\ninformation was issued on radiation levels, on subsequent accidents at the\nsite, on contamination levels of the Kiev water supply, on severe discipline\nagainst non-volunteer cleanup personnel, on reactor entombment schedules and on\noperator training levels.\n</P>\n<P>\nA severe 1986-1987 countrywide electrical power shortage was officially denied\nalthough it was real enough to compel the restart of three Chernobyl reactors\nin explicit violation of Soviet safety regulations. Design deficiencies of the\nChernobyl-style reactors were downplayed and human errors were declared to be\nthe primary culprit.\n</P>\n<P>\nUltimately, observes the author, \"It is ironic that in an era of openness,\nChernobyl may have been both the pioneer of glasnost under Gorbachev and then\nsubsequently its first casualty.\" He ultimately concludes, \"Aspects of the\ndisaster . . . have rarely been dealt with thoroughly or even honestly by\nSoviet sources.\" Hence the need for this book, a need which is admirably\nfulfilled despite the many remaining mysteries and uncertainties.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe July, 1987, trial of reactor personnel marked a full circle of disclosure.\nJournalists were allowed into the pre-scripted first and last days, but the\nweeklong deliberative sessions were held in secret and no word of their\nsubstance has ever been released.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe propaganda purpose of the trial and surrounding official publicity, he\nmaintains, had one goal: \"To divert culpability from the party hierarchy, in\nKiev and especially in Moscow.\" This is precisely the theme I have also\nencountered in my own investigations of aerospace accidents of the past. Where\nindividual human failings led to catastrophe, a sanitized story may eventually\nbe released, but where Kremlin policy led to disaster (such as the Nedelin\ncatastrophe of 1960 or the Soyuz-1 disaster in 1967), the entire event remains\nabsolutely off limits to glasnost.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe closing blow-by-blow description of the nuclear power debate presages a\ndramatic event which occurred too recently for inclusion in this first edition.\nViktor Legasov, tagged by the author as one of the country's two leading\npro-nuclear advocates, actually was sinking into private despair over the poor\nimplementation of safety standards. In the end, he made his final and most\neloquent testimony to this despair on the second anniversary of the accident,\nby committing suicide. For several weeks the Soviets tried to sit on the\ncircumstances of his \"tragic death,\" even issuing official non-explanations\nwhich asserted that the death was not due to medical effects of radiation.\nFinally, crusading journalist Vladimir Gubarev, with access to Legasov's\nnotebooks, broke the story in Pravda. Readers of this book will come to know\nthese and other characters so well that the suicide fits right into the \"big\npicture\" of the catastrophe's social impacts.\n</P>\n<P>\nFor an author to so accurately describe a social milieu that subsequent\nunpredictable events only enhance his insights is testimony to the highest\nquality of scholarship. Readers of Marples' book will rarely be surprised as\nthe Chernobyl catastrophe's consequences continue to unfold in the future.\n</P>\n</TEXT>",

During the last campaign, Democrats and Republicans\nformed a commission to grab sponsorship of the last presidential debate away\nfrom the League of Women Voters. The result was that the two presidential\ncampaigns were able to dictate ground rules that resulted not in a real debate\nbut in an excessively restricted and programmed question-answer session.\n</P>\n<P>\nNow the parties have joined in a new bipartisan commission to do something\nabout the national political conventions. The commission has been directed to\npropose ways of streamlining the conventions so that they are more appealing to\nAmericans on television. This is in obvious response to the poor ratings that\nthe conventions drew last summer and to network television's reluctance to\ncarry the entire proceedings. Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., the retiring Republican\nnational chairman, said that there had been criticism from the media that the\nconventions \"have become nothing more than staged activities in which nominees\ngive canned speeches.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nThe problem is that this dog is barking up the wrong tree. What needs fixing is\nthe pre-convention nominating process that goes on forever and produces winners\nlong before the delegates gather. The prospective nominees thus have control of\nthe convention program and arrange things so that there is a minimum of\nuncertainty and controversy. This year even the names of the vice presidential\nrunning mates were known in advance, so the conventions were robbed of any\nremaining tidbit of suspense.\n</P>\n<P>\nWhat the national parties must do is shorten the primary campaign and start it\nsomeplace other than Iowa or New Hampshire. They need to be willing to have\nactual issues debated on the convention floor. They need some spontaneity and\nreal action -- perhaps even a multiple roll-call contest for the nomination.\nThey do not need more programming, but less. Fix the primary process, and the\nconvention problem will fix itself.\n</P>\n</TEXT>",

Haddon said, \"and people just kind of stare in disbelief.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"This is Gardena, but it's not. Even the post office says 'Gardena,' but the\nreality is, we do not live in Gardena. . . . If we had a fire . . . the\nresponse would come from the city of Los Angeles.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nThat is a complicated fact of life in Harbor Gateway, the 8-mile long,\n4-block-wide umbilical cord acquired at the turn of the century to link Los\nAngeles to its port.\n</P>\n<P>\nIn a city where community names conjure up images -- Venice, Silver Lake, Boyle\nHeights -- Harbor Gateway draws a blank.\n</P>\n<P>\nBounded on the west by Gardena and Torrance and on the east by Carson and\nunincorporated county land, the area was for decades known as the \"city strip,\"\nthe \"shoestring strip\" or, simply, \"the strip.\"\n</P>\n<P>\n</P>\n<P>\nArea Rechristened\n</P>\n<P>\nFour years ago, the Los Angeles City Council rechristened the area to try to\nbring a sense of identity and community pride to its citizens -- some of whom\ndo not even know they live in Los Angeles.\n</P>\n<P>\nHarbor Gateway lacks much of what makes a community a community -- no central\nbusiness district, no civic center or gathering place, no library branch, no\npolice station and, as Haddon noted, no post office. Its largest park is a\ncemetery. And, despite the new name, mailing addresses of residents remain\nunchanged. They still say Torrance or Gardena, not Los Angeles.\n</P>\n<P>\nNot surprisingly, this leaves some people confused.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"They say, 'Look, my mailing address is Gardena,' \" reported Gene Painter, the\ncity of Gardena's superintendent of human services who said he does not turn\naway Harbor Gateway residents who ask for help. \"Strange as it may seem, they\ndon't know where they live.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nOptician Chris Toughill joined the Torrance Chamber of Commerce when he opened\nhis shop in a Harbor Gateway strip mall, and his neighbors did the same. It\nwasn't until the Torrance mayor declined to attend their grand opening,\nToughill said, that the merchants discovered that they were in Los Angeles.\n</P>\n<P>\nEven the young toughs of the Gardena 13 gang, interviewed while hanging out on\na Harbor Gateway street corner, insisted they were standing in Gardena.\n</P>\n<P>\nIn population, Harbor Gateway is tied with Westwood as Los Angeles'\nsecond-fastest growing area. Sylmar is first. Between 1980 and 1986, according\nto Los Angeles Planning Department estimates, Harbor Gateway's population\nincreased 15.6%, from 30,238 to 34,951.\n</P>\n<P>\nA drive through the Gateway is like a trip from the city to the suburbs. On the\nnorth end, which begins at El Segundo Boulevard, there are apartments needing\nrepair, gang graffiti on walls and single-family homes with barred windows. The\nsouthern end -- which stops at Sepulveda Boulevard, where Harbor City begins --\nis punctuated by newly built strip malls, condominiums and well-manicured\nlawns.\n</P>\n<P>\nProperty values follow a similar pattern, with the lowest prices in the north.\nHome values in nearby Torrance or Gardena, however, are considerably higher.\nReal estate agents report that a house in Harbor Gateway might sell for as much\nas $50,000 less than one across the street in another community.\n</P>\n<P>\nAgents attribute the difference to better city services, particularly in\nTorrance, which has its own schools.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"The minute you mention Los Angeles,\" said Gardena real estate agent John\nWarner, \"it frightens . . . people away. It's just one of those things. Homes\nhave always been cheaper over there (Harbor Gateway).\"\n</P>\n<P>\nSaid resident Betty Roy: \"I hate to be known to live in the strip. When my\nfriends ask where I live, I tell them Torrance.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nIndeed, four years after the name change -- in spite of spiffy blue-and-white\nsigns that declare \"Harbor Gateway\" below the Los Angeles city seal -- those\nwho live and work there say they still feel betwixt and between, not fully a\npart of Los Angeles, Harbor Gateway or the bordering cities.\n</P>\n<P>\n</P>\n<P>\n'In Limbo'\n</P>\n<P>\nMoreover, they complain that their new moniker has not brought with it what\nthey really want: more attention from city officials, better services such as\nstreet cleaning and tree trimming and, above all, increased police protection.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"We're like in limbo,\" said Roy, a longtime resident of the Gateway's southern\nend. \"We're not really Torrance and we're not really Carson. . . . We're only\nhere because Los Angeles needs this little piece of land to attach to the\nharbor. Nobody cares about us. . . . We're like the forgotten people.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nFor Sylvia Figueroa, life on the border means a daily struggle at It's a\nMiracle, the Mexican pizza parlor she opened a year ago at Gardena Boulevard\nand Vermont Avenue in Los Angeles.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe city of Gardena is across the street, and the differences are stark. On the\nGardena side, Gardena Boulevard -- that city's main business thoroughfare -- is\ngetting a face lift. The street is clean, and the trees are neatly trimmed.\nCity officials are offering grants to business owners for renovations.\n</P>\n<P>\n</P>\n<P>\nNeighborhood Contrasts\n</P>\n<P>\nAcross the street in Los Angeles, the trees are scraggly and overgrown,\nvagrants sleep in a littered vacant lot, liquor stores abound and the Gardena\n13 gang seems to own the corner.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"The other side there's no drunk people, no people looking for drugs,\" said\nFigueroa, who sweeps her sidewalk regularly. \"The other side is so clean. Even\nthe sidewalk is clean.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"You see the street?\" she asked, pointing to a pile of litter. \"That's\nterrible.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nLos Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who represents the area,\nconceded that the Gateway is not getting its share of services.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"It's difficult to get a library in there, because no matter where you put a\nlibrary in the Gateway, you only serve a limited number of city residents,\" she\nsaid. \"It's difficult to get a street cleaning service on a regular basis\nbecause they have to come from somewhere else to get there. . . . It's not like\nhaving a nice, round community where you have something in the middle and it\nserves everybody around it.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nThe United Way apparently agrees. In March, the umbrella agency's\nHarbor/Southeast division declared Harbor Gateway an \"under-served geographic\narea,\" citing \"real gaps in law enforcement\" and social services.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe declaration is part of a long-term plan by the United Way to upgrade Harbor\nGateway by organizing neighborhood leaders to form nonprofit programs for\nresidents.\n</P>\n<P>\nA citizens group, chaired by Haddon, is setting goals for the project,\napparently marking the first time that community leaders around the Gateway\nhave come together to talk about the area's problems. The minister and some\nothers agree that the first goal should be improving community pride and\ncohesiveness to create political clout.\n</P>\n<P>\nTo do that, residents must reverse 82 years of history.\n</P>\n<P>\nOver the years, since the so-called Shoestring Strip Annexation of Dec. 26,\n1906, Harbor Gateway residents have somehow coalesced into five distinct\nneighborhoods. From north to south, their rough boundaries are El Segundo\nBoulevard to Rosecrans Avenue; Rosecrans to Redondo Beach Boulevard; Redondo\nBeach to Artesia Boulevard; Artesia to 190th Street; and 190th Street to\nSepulveda Boulevard. The east-west boundaries of the three northern\nneighborhoods are Vermont Avenue and Figueroa Street, while Western and\nNormandie avenues bound the two in the south.\n</P>\n<P>\nOverall, Harbor Gateway is a racially mixed, middle-income area, with an\nestimated median household income of $30,431 and a population that is 48.4%\nwhite, 13.2% black, 16.5% Asian and 21.8% other racial groups, according to the\n1980 census, the most recent statistics available.\n</P>\n<P>\nLatinos -- whose numbers are not tallied as part of the racial breakdown in the\n1980 census -- are Harbor Gateway's largest minority group, accounting for\n32.9% of the overall population, according to census data.\n</P>\n<P>\nHowever, the picture changes when the area is more closely examined.\nDemographic statistics show that the various Gateway neighborhoods often\nresemble adjacent communities more closely than they do one another.\n</P>\n<P>\nFor example, the two Gateway neighborhoods near south South-Central Los Angeles\nand Compton have the heaviest concentration of blacks, 44.7%. Whites make up\n23.6% of those two neighborhoods, which extend north from Redondo Beach\nBoulevard, and Asians make up 6.9%. The estimated median household income there\nis $27,453.\n</P>\n<P>\n</P>\n<P>\nMake-Up of Community\n</P>\n<P>\nBut in the strip's midsection, from Artesia Boulevard to 190th Street, the\npopulation reflects that of the southern end of Gardena, which is heavily\nAsian. There, the black population is minuscule -- just 0.4% -- with most of\nthe population split between whites, 48.1%, and Asians, 44.8%. Estimated\nhousehold income in this section jumps dramatically, to $44,498.\n</P>\n<P>\nAnd south of 190th Street, approaching predominantly white Torrance, the white\npopulation jumps even higher, to 66.3%, while the Asian population dips to 8.6%\nand the number of blacks rises slightly, to 2%. Median household income is\n$27,607.\n</P>\n<P>\nAlthough it is primarily residential, the Gateway also includes a burgeoning\nbusiness district at the San Diego and Harbor freeways, where, according to the\nCalifornia Department of Transportation, 500,000 cars drive by each day, making\nit the second-busiest intersection in Southern California.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe so-called 190th Street Corridor is a major drawing card for commercial\ndevelopers, who have built about 5 million square feet of office space there in\nthe last eight years. Gleaming high-rises with pleasant landscaping have\nreplaced a Shell oil refinery and manufacturing plants.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"We sort of had a shift from the Industrial Age to the Information Age,\" said\nHoward Mann, president of Andrex Development Co., one of the area's major\ndevelopers.\n</P>\n<P>\nMann predicts that the move away from industrial to commercial uses will help\nupgrade nearby areas by attracting home buyers who hold high-paying jobs in\nwhat he calls Harbor Gateway's \"urban cluster.\" Already, he is planning a\nrestaurant to meet that market, based on an analysis that, he said, \"found that\nthe average income per household within a 5-mile radius of this intersection is\n$50,000.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nDining in elegance, however, is certainly not a priority farther north in\nHarbor Gateway, where large concentrations of undocumented Latinos residents\nare struggling to get by.\n</P>\n<P>\nA study by the United Way found that illegal Latino immigrants are the \"most\nunder-served\" group in the Gateway.\n</P>\n<P>\nHaddon and other local leaders said their presence also makes it difficult to\nform neighborhood coalitions because illegal aliens fear they will attract\nunwanted attention from immigration authorities if they participate in\ncommunity affairs.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"Their need is to be invisible,\" the minister said, \"and that does not make for\na good community.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nHaddon is particularly attuned to the problems of undocumented residents\nbecause his church runs the 3-year-old Harbor Gateway Center, one of only two\nsocial service agencies the United Way found serving the strip.\n</P>\n<P>\n</P>\n<P>\nCenter's Problems\n</P>\n<P>\nThe center -- which offers a variety of nutritional, health and educational\nprograms to about 1,500 people -- lacks money and staff. The executive director\nleft more than a year ago when the money to pay her ran out. Haddon, who took\nthe pastor's job in July, has been doing her job ever since.\n</P>\n<P>\nUnited Way officials say they would like to strengthen the center and also\npersuade social service agencies in neighboring communities to expand\noperations here. Their study showed that the area lacks adequate shelters for\nbattered women, delinquency prevention programs, drug- and alcohol-abuse\nprograms and crisis intervention centers.\n</P>\n<P>\nIf there is one common thread in the complaints from Gateway residents, it is\nthe increasing gang activity and the lack of police protection. Many said that\nthey go for days without seeing a patrol car and that officers covering the\narea are often sent on calls elsewhere.\n</P>\n<P>\nLos Angeles police officials said they have been trying to improve service,\nespecially during the past year when citizens groups and Flores have pressed\nfor additional patrols. But they also acknowledged that cars are called out of\nthe area more often than they would like. Capt. Sandy Wasson of the Los Angeles\nPolice Department's Southeast Division, which covers the part of the strip\nnorth of the San Diego Freeway, took issue with residents who say Harbor\nGateway gets less than its fair share of coverage. He said a recent deployment\nstudy showed that while the area has fewer patrol cars -- just one basic car in\nthe north and one in the south -- it also has less crime.\n</P>\n<P>\nWasson said he views Harbor Gateway as \"a neighborhood in transition that's got\ngreat potential.\" He has encouraged the formation of neighborhood watch groups.\n</P>\n<P>\nFlores, for one, said she senses a growing participation in such groups and \"a\nrenewed interest in community improvement.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nShe maintained that the city has improved services in recent years, especially\npolice coverage. She also noted that a Harbor Gateway paramedic unit was\nestablished in June and that this year, the city Library Department finally\nincluded a proposal for a Harbor Gateway branch in its long-term plan.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe councilwoman said she would like the Gateway to have its own post office\nand ZIP code.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"I think it's important,\" she said, \"to have an actual tag and title on who you\nare and where you are.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nBut she said she knows persuading the federal government will be difficult.\n</P>\n<P>\nIn the meantime, Flores said, she is thankful for whatever recognition the new\nname has brought the area.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"At least,\" she said, \"I know that when I mention Harbor Gateway in City\nCouncil now, my colleagues know what I'm talking about.\"\n</P>\n</TEXT>",

It was a fitting end to a year that proved stronger than expected,\nwith the Dow increasing 12%.\n</P>\n<P>\nIt was equally fitting that the best performing Orange County stocks of 1988\nwere among those hardest hit by the crash.\n</P>\n<P>\nOrange County's star performers managed to rescue themselves from the rubble to\neither approach or surpass their pre-crash highs. In most cases, analysts said,\nthey are solid companies that enjoyed healthy returns.\n</P>\n<P>\nICN Biomedicals, a Costa Mesa medical instruments and chemicals company, led\nthe pack on a percentage basis. The stock rose 331%, starting the year at $3.25\nand finishing at $14.\n</P>\n<P>\nFor the first 9 months of its current fiscal year, ICN Biomedicals has enjoyed\na 35% increase in earnings. Its third-quarter performance was even stronger,\nwith profits up 59%.\n</P>\n<P>\nGradco Corp., an Irvine manufacturer of office copier and printer products,\nplaced second, appreciating 126% for the year. Gradco stock, which began the\nyear at $5.875, closed at $13.25.\n</P>\n<P>\nIn the fiscal year ended March, 1988, Gradco reported net income of $4.1\nmillion on sales of $90.9 million, and the company continued to post strong\nnumbers over the latter part of the year.\n</P>\n<P>\nDuring the past 12 months, most investors steered clear of small companies.\nMany had been burned badly by the crash.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"A lot of the smaller Orange County companies are not very liquid, and they\njust got hammered in the crash, as people fell over themselves to get out of\nthem,\" said Larry Selwitz, director of research at Cruttenden &amp; Co., a\nNewport Beach brokerage.\n</P>\n<P>\nMany investors who got back into the market in 1988 initially chose to buy\nstocks in larger, more established companies.\n</P>\n<P>\nBut as the year wore on and many Orange County companies began to report strong\nearnings, investors started funneling money into such companies as ICN\nBiomedicals, Ropak and Gradco.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"The stock of some of these companies had become so oversold that people\nrealized these prices offered unusually good value,\" Selwitz said. \"It was an\nopportunity for people to make a lot of money.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nMeanwhile, the county's biggest market losers generally reflected unspectacular\ncorporate performance.\n</P>\n<P>\nResdel Industries, a Newport Beach electronics firm, lost the most ground in\n1988. Its stock began the year at $5.25 a share and crashed to $1.4375, a 73%\ndecline.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe company posted an $8.3-million loss for the year ended June 30 and\ndisclosed in October that it had laid off 130 people, or more than a third of\nits work force. The firm's problems were attributed primarily to unsuccessful\nefforts to expand through acquisitions.\n</P>\n<P>\nAnother bomb was Diceon Electronics, which began the year trading at $30.50 but\ndeclined to $12.50 at year end, losing 59% of its value.\n</P>\n<P>\nDiceon had sales of $147 million and earned $9.8 million in the fiscal year\nended in September. But most of its profits were realized in the first 6 months\nof the year, while the second half was a dud. Analysts are projecting that the\ncompany will have flat earnings for the first half of 1989.\n</P>\n<P>\nAs a result, Diceon, which for several years has been one of Orange County's\ntop performing growth companies, was snubbed by analysts and investors.\n</P>\n<P>\nPreston Athey, a growth fund manager for T. Rowe Price in Baltimore, said he\ncontinues to hold Diceon and several other Orange County stocks because of what\nhe believes are bright prospects for small growth companies in 1989.\n</P>\n<P>\nT. Rowe Price has about $1.3 billion invested in emerging growth funds. The\ninvestment firm's Orange County holdings include National Education of Irvine,\nSilicon Systems of Tustin and Archive Corp.\n</P>\n<P>\nAthey said a statistical indicator used by T. Rowe Price recently signaled that\nmany, small growth companies \"are grossly undervalued\" relative to historic\nnorms.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"If the past is any indication, 1989 is the year that these stocks will do very\nwell relative to the rest of the market,\" Athey said.\n</P>\n<P>\nHe said he is particularly bullish about small growth companies because many\neconomists and analysts are projecting
