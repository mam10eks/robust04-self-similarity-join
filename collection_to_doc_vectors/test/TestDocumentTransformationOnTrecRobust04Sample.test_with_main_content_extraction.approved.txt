        "content": "NEW FALLOUT FROM CHERNOBYL;\nTHE SOCIAL IMPACT OF THE CHERNOBYL DISASTER BY DAVID R. MARPLES (ST. MARTIN'S  PRESS: $35, CLOTH; $14.95, PAPER; 316 PP., ILLUSTRATED; 0-312-02432-0)\nThe onset of the new Gorbachev policy of glasnost, commonly mistranslated as  openness but closer in connotation to candor or publicizing, has complicated  the task of Soviet secret-keepers and has allowed substantial new Western  insights into Soviet society. David R. Marples' new book, his second on the  Chernobyl accident of April 26, 1986, is a shining example of the best type of  non-Soviet analysis into topics that only recently were absolutely taboo in  Moscow official circles.\nThe author, a British-educated historian and economist, is a research associate  with the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies at the University of Alberta,  and the academic style of the book is undisguised. However, its intended  audience is the general public, and anyone interested in nuclear power, or  Soviet economy and society, or human drama, or just plain sleuthing state  secrets, will find hitherto unpublished revelations and explanations of the  event and its continuing aftermath.\nThe effects of Chernobyl reverberated throughout so many facets of Soviet  society that a continuous coherent narrative is probably impossible. Marples  discusses half a dozen major themes arranged in a fairly arbitrary order (as  indicated by the frequent and helpful cross references throughout the text) and  succeeds in mapping out his main themes. The personal interests of each reader  determine which of the sections may be deemed too detailed and which too  sketchy, but considering the need for such a comprehensive overview, the levels  are generally appropriate.\nThe book is, on the one hand, not a light read, and an executive summary might  have been possible in a quarter the length. But, on the other, so many of the  judgments depend on a subtle interpretation of a multitude of sources that the  author is obligated to present the raw data for the reader's inspection. The  modular nature of the book also allows a reader to skip, browse, and revisit  earlier sections, aided by a convenient internal organization and a thorough  index.\nFirst in the world's attention, and in the text, is a discussion of the human  victims of the accident. The official tally is 31 (only about 20 names have  ever been released), but Marples suspects there were other short-term radiation  victims. A large number of unnecessary late-term abortions were also performed  on local women, and by rights those unborn babies count as casualties.  Widespread \"radiophobia\" led to restricted diets which created malnourishment  and subsequent disease in thousands of people. The tens of thousands of people  taking part in cleanup operations were never included in official totals of  those exposed. Since the book went to press, Soviet military sources have  referred to at least one death in the actual reactor entombment program.\nBut the greatest toll is likely to occur with the delayed deaths. Here, Marples  encounters for the first time the soon familiar theme of official Soviet  myth-making around the event: Reality is twisted to serve state policy  objectives, which include calming an alarmed public with assurances that all is  well when it isn't.\nAnd thus is born what he properly labels the \"myth of Chernobyl,\" the official  line that the disaster provided a test that Soviet society passed with honor.  \"In the Soviet view,\" he writes, \"it was first and foremost a victory, a story  with an ending, and an ending that was triumphant.\"\nThus, when sober Western medical estimates placed the future \"excess cancer  deaths\" at several tens of thousands, both in the Soviet Union and in Europe (a  few tenths of a percent elevation of the natural cancer rate), the Soviets  reacted furiously. The estimates are branded \"nonsense\" and the estimators are  dismissed as \"panic mongers\" promulgating \"anti-Soviet venom.\"\nSubsequently the author addresses themes of environmental impact, economic and  political repercussions, public images, and the recovery operations. Along the  way, Marples provides a damning list of examples in which Soviet officials  attempted to retreat behind old-style cover-ups and outright lies. False  information was issued on radiation levels, on subsequent accidents at the  site, on contamination levels of the Kiev water supply, on severe discipline  against non-volunteer cleanup personnel, on reactor entombment schedules and on  operator training levels.\nA severe 1986-1987 countrywide electrical power shortage was officially denied  although it was real enough to compel the restart of three Chernobyl reactors  in explicit violation of Soviet safety regulations. Design deficiencies of the  Chernobyl-style reactors were downplayed and human errors were declared to be  the primary culprit.\nUltimately, observes the author, \"It is ironic that in an era of openness,  Chernobyl may have been both the pioneer of glasnost under Gorbachev and then  subsequently its first casualty.\" He ultimately concludes, \"Aspects of the  disaster . . . have rarely been dealt with thoroughly or even honestly by  Soviet sources.\" Hence the need for this book, a need which is admirably  fulfilled despite the many remaining mysteries and uncertainties.\nThe July, 1987, trial of reactor personnel marked a full circle of disclosure.  Journalists were allowed into the pre-scripted first and last days, but the  weeklong deliberative sessions were held in secret and no word of their  substance has ever been released.\nThe propaganda purpose of the trial and surrounding official publicity, he  maintains, had one goal: \"To divert culpability from the party hierarchy, in  Kiev and especially in Moscow.\" This is precisely the theme I have also  encountered in my own investigations of aerospace accidents of the past. Where  individual human failings led to catastrophe, a sanitized story may eventually  be released, but where Kremlin policy led to disaster (such as the Nedelin  catastrophe of 1960 or the Soyuz-1 disaster in 1967), the entire event remains  absolutely off limits to glasnost.\n\n",

        "content": "FIXING THE WRONG THING\nWhen the two national political parties begin working together to make things  \"better,\" better beware. During the last campaign, Democrats and Republicans  formed a commission to grab sponsorship of the last presidential debate away  from the League of Women Voters. The result was that the two presidential  campaigns were able to dictate ground rules that resulted not in a real debate  but in an excessively restricted and programmed question-answer session.\nNow the parties have joined in a new bipartisan commission to do something  about the national political conventions. The commission has been directed to  propose ways of streamlining the conventions so that they are more appealing to  Americans on television. This is in obvious response to the poor ratings that  the conventions drew last summer and to network television's reluctance to  carry the entire proceedings. Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., the retiring Republican  national chairman, said that there had been criticism from the media that the  conventions \"have become nothing more than staged activities in which nominees  give canned speeches.\"\nThe problem is that this dog is barking up the wrong tree. What needs fixing is  the pre-convention nominating process that goes on forever and produces winners  long before the delegates gather. The prospective nominees thus have control of  the convention program and arrange things so that there is a minimum of  uncertainty and controversy. This year even the names of the vice presidential  running mates were known in advance, so the conventions were robbed of any  remaining tidbit of suspense.\n\n",

        "content": "IN SEARCH OF AN IDENTITY;\nAREA LACKS A SENSE OF COMMUNITY\nDick Haddon's church has an identity problem.\n\"I tell people that the First United Methodist Church of Gardena is not in  Gardena,\" the Rev. Haddon said, \"and people just kind of stare in disbelief.\n\"This is Gardena, but it's not. Even the post office says 'Gardena,' but the  reality is, we do not live in Gardena. . . . If we had a fire . . . the  response would come from the city of Los Angeles.\"\nThat is a complicated fact of life in Harbor Gateway, the 8-mile long,  4-block-wide umbilical cord acquired at the turn of the century to link Los  Angeles to its port.\nIn a city where community names conjure up images -- Venice, Silver Lake, Boyle  Heights -- Harbor Gateway draws a blank.\nBounded on the west by Gardena and Torrance and on the east by Carson and  unincorporated county land, the area was for decades known as the \"city strip,\"  the \"shoestring strip\" or, simply, \"the strip.\"\nArea Rechristened\nFour years ago, the Los Angeles City Council rechristened the area to try to  bring a sense of identity and community pride to its citizens -- some of whom  do not even know they live in Los Angeles.\nHarbor Gateway lacks much of what makes a community a community -- no central  business district, no civic center or gathering place, no library branch, no  police station and, as Haddon noted, no post office. Its largest park is a  cemetery. And, despite the new name, mailing addresses of residents remain  unchanged. They still say Torrance or Gardena, not Los Angeles.\nNot surprisingly, this leaves some people confused.\n\"They say, 'Look, my mailing address is Gardena,' \" reported Gene Painter, the  city of Gardena's superintendent of human services who said he does not turn  away Harbor Gateway residents who ask for help. \"Strange as it may seem, they  don't know where they live.\"\nOptician Chris Toughill joined the Torrance Chamber of Commerce when he opened  his shop in a Harbor Gateway strip mall, and his neighbors did the same. It  wasn't until the Torrance mayor declined to attend their grand opening,  Toughill said, that the merchants discovered that they were in Los Angeles.\nEven the young toughs of the Gardena 13 gang, interviewed while hanging out on  a Harbor Gateway street corner, insisted they were standing in Gardena.\nIn population, Harbor Gateway is tied with Westwood as Los Angeles'  second-fastest growing area. Sylmar is first. Between 1980 and 1986, according  to Los Angeles Planning Department estimates, Harbor Gateway's population  increased 15.6%, from 30,238 to 34,951.\nA drive through the Gateway is like a trip from the city to the suburbs. On the  north end, which begins at El Segundo Boulevard, there are apartments needing  repair, gang graffiti on walls and single-family homes with barred windows. The  southern end -- which stops at Sepulveda Boulevard, where Harbor City begins --  is punctuated by newly built strip malls, condominiums and well-manicured  lawns.\nProperty values follow a similar pattern, with the lowest prices in the north.  Home values in nearby Torrance or Gardena, however, are considerably higher.  Real estate agents report that a house in Harbor Gateway might sell for as much  as $50,000 less than one across the street in another community.\nAgents attribute the difference to better city services, particularly in  Torrance, which has its own schools.\n\"The minute you mention Los Angeles,\" said Gardena real estate agent John  Warner, \"it frightens . . . people away. It's just one of those things. Homes  have always been cheaper over there (Harbor Gateway).\"\nSaid resident Betty Roy: \"I hate to be known to live in the strip. When my  friends ask where I live, I tell them Torrance.\"\nIndeed, four years after the name change -- in spite of spiffy blue-and-white  signs that declare \"Harbor Gateway\" below the Los Angeles city seal -- those  who live and work there say they still feel betwixt and between, not fully a  part of Los Angeles, Harbor Gateway or the bordering cities.\n'In Limbo'\nMoreover, they complain that their new moniker has not brought with it what  they really want: more attention from city officials, better services such as  street cleaning and tree trimming and, above all, increased police protection.\n\"We're like in limbo,\" said Roy, a longtime resident of the Gateway's southern  end. \"We're not really Torrance and we're not really Carson. . . . We're only  here because Los Angeles needs this little piece of land to attach to the  harbor. Nobody cares about us. . . . We're like the forgotten people.\"\nFor Sylvia Figueroa, life on the border means a daily struggle at It's a  Miracle, the Mexican pizza parlor she opened a year ago at Gardena Boulevard  and Vermont Avenue in Los Angeles.\nThe city of Gardena is across the street, and the differences are stark. On the  Gardena side, Gardena Boulevard -- that city's main business thoroughfare -- is  getting a face lift. The street is clean, and the trees are neatly trimmed.  City officials are offering grants to business owners for renovations.\nNeighborhood Contrasts\nAcross the street in Los Angeles, the trees are scraggly and overgrown,  vagrants sleep in a littered vacant lot, liquor stores abound and the Gardena  13 gang seems to own the corner.\n\"The other side there's no drunk people, no people looking for drugs,\" said  Figueroa, who sweeps her sidewalk regularly. \"The other side is so clean. Even  the sidewalk is clean.\n\"You see the street?\" she asked, pointing to a pile of litter. \"That's  terrible.\"\nLos Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who represents the area,  conceded that the Gateway is not getting its share of services.\n\"It's difficult to get a library in there, because no matter where you put a  library in the Gateway, you only serve a limited number of city residents,\" she  said. \"It's difficult to get a street cleaning service on a regular basis  because they have to come from somewhere else to get there. . . . It's not like  having a nice, round community where you have something in the middle and it  serves everybody around it.\"\nThe United Way apparently agrees. In March, the umbrella agency's  Harbor/Southeast division declared Harbor Gateway an \"under-served geographic  area,\" citing \"real gaps in law enforcement\" and social services.\nThe declaration is part of a long-term plan by the United Way to upgrade Harbor  Gateway by organizing neighborhood leaders to form nonprofit programs for  residents.\nA citizens group, chaired by Haddon, is setting goals for the project,  apparently marking the first time that community leaders around the Gateway  have come together to talk about the area's problems. The minister and some  others agree that the first goal should be improving community pride and  cohesiveness to create political clout.\nTo do that, residents must reverse 82 years of history.\nOver the years, since the so-called Shoestring Strip Annexation of Dec. 26,  1906, Harbor Gateway residents have somehow coalesced into five distinct  neighborhoods. From north to south, their rough boundaries are El Segundo  Boulevard to Rosecrans Avenue; Rosecrans to Redondo Beach Boulevard; Redondo  Beach to Artesia Boulevard; Artesia to 190th Street; and 190th Street to  Sepulveda Boulevard. The east-west boundaries of the three northern  neighborhoods are Vermont Avenue and Figueroa Street, while Western and  Normandie avenues bound the two in the south.\nOverall, Harbor Gateway is a racially mixed, middle-income area, with an  estimated median household income of $30,431 and a population that is 48.4%  white, 13.2% black, 16.5% Asian and 21.8% other racial groups, according to the  1980 census, the most recent statistics available.\nLatinos -- whose numbers are not tallied as part of the racial breakdown in the  1980 census -- are Harbor Gateway's largest minority group, accounting for  32.9% of the overall population, according to census data.\nHowever, the picture changes when the area is more closely examined.  Demographic statistics show that the various Gateway neighborhoods often  resemble adjacent communities more closely than they do one another.\nFor example, the two Gateway neighborhoods near south South-Central Los Angeles  and Compton have the heaviest concentration of blacks, 44.7%. Whites make up  23.6% of those two neighborhoods, which extend north from Redondo Beach  Boulevard, and Asians make up 6.9%. The estimated median household income there  is $27,453.\nMake-Up of Community\nBut in the strip's midsection, from Artesia Boulevard to 190th Street, the  population reflects that of the southern end of Gardena, which is heavily  Asian. There, the black population is minuscule -- just 0.4% -- with most of  the population split between whites, 48.1%, and Asians, 44.8%. Estimated  household income in this section jumps dramatically, to $44,498.\nAnd south of 190th Street, approaching predominantly white Torrance, the white  population jumps even higher, to 66.3%, while the Asian population dips to 8.6%  and the number of blacks rises slightly, to 2%. Median household income is  $27,607.\nAlthough it is primarily residential, the Gateway also includes a burgeoning  business district at the San Diego and Harbor freeways, where, according to the  California Department of Transportation, 500,000 cars drive by each day, making  it the second-busiest intersection in Southern California.\nThe so-called 190th Street Corridor is a major drawing card for commercial  developers, who have built about 5 million square feet of office space there in  the last eight years. Gleaming high-rises with pleasant landscaping have  replaced a Shell oil refinery and manufacturing plants.\n\"We sort of had a shift from the Industrial Age to the Information Age,\" said  Howard Mann, president of Andrex Development Co., one of the area's major  developers.\nMann predicts that the move away from industrial to commercial uses will help  upgrade nearby areas by attracting home buyers who hold high-paying jobs in  what he calls Harbor Gateway's \"urban cluster.\" Already, he is planning a  restaurant to meet that market, based on an analysis that, he said, \"found that  the average income per household within a 5-mile radius of this intersection is  $50,000.\"\nDining in elegance, however, is certainly not a priority farther north in  Harbor Gateway, where large concentrations of undocumented Latinos residents  are struggling to get by.\nA study by the United Way found that illegal Latino immigrants are the \"most  under-served\" group in the Gateway.\nHaddon and other local leaders said their presence also makes it difficult to  form neighborhood coalitions because illegal aliens fear they will attract  unwanted attention from immigration authorities if they participate in  community affairs.\n\"Their need is to be invisible,\" the minister said, \"and that does not make for  a good community.\"\nHaddon is particularly attuned to the problems of undocumented residents  because his church runs the 3-year-old Harbor Gateway Center, one of only two  social service agencies the United Way found serving the strip.\nCenter's Problems\nThe center -- which offers a variety of nutritional, health and educational  programs to about 1,500 people -- lacks money and staff. The executive director  left more than a year ago when the money to pay her ran out. Haddon, who took  the pastor's job in July, has been doing her job ever since.\nUnited Way officials say they would like to strengthen the center and also  persuade social service agencies in neighboring communities to expand  operations here. Their study showed that the area lacks adequate shelters for  battered women, delinquency prevention programs, drug- and alcohol-abuse  programs and crisis intervention centers.\nIf there is one common thread in the complaints from Gateway residents, it is  the increasing gang activity and the lack of police protection. Many said that  they go for days without seeing a patrol car and that officers covering the  area are often sent on calls elsewhere.\nLos Angeles police officials said they have been trying to improve service,  especially during the past year when citizens groups and Flores have pressed  for additional patrols. But they also acknowledged that cars are called out of  the area more often than they would like. Capt. Sandy Wasson of the Los Angeles  Police Department's Southeast Division, which covers the part of the strip  north of the San Diego Freeway, took issue with residents who say Harbor  Gateway gets less than its fair share of coverage. He said a recent deployment  study showed that while the area has fewer patrol cars -- just one basic car in  the north and one in the south -- it also has less crime.\nWasson said he views Harbor Gateway as \"a neighborhood in transition that's got  great potential.\" He has encouraged the formation of neighborhood watch groups.\nFlores, for one, said she senses a growing participation in such groups and \"a  renewed interest in community improvement.\"\nShe maintained that the city has improved services in recent years, especially  police coverage. She also noted that a Harbor Gateway paramedic unit was  established in June and that this year, the city Library Department finally  included a proposal for a Harbor Gateway branch in its long-term plan.\nThe councilwoman said she would like the Gateway to have its own post office  and ZIP code.\n\"I think it's important,\" she said, \"to have an actual tag and title on who you  are and where you are.\"\nBut she said she knows persuading the federal government will be difficult.\nIn the meantime, Flores said, she is thankful for whatever recognition the new  name has brought the area.\n\n",

        "content": "January 1, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition\nSTOCK WATCH: SOME COMPANIES HIT HARDEST BY CRASH PICKED UP THE PIECES, CAME OUT  AHEAD\nOn Friday, the last trading day of 1988, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  briefly climbed above the level it had enjoyed before the October, 1987, market  collapse. It was a fitting end to a year that proved stronger than expected,  with the Dow increasing 12%.\nIt was equally fitting that the best performing Orange County stocks of 1988  were among those hardest hit by the crash.\nOrange County's star performers managed to rescue themselves from the rubble to  either approach or surpass their pre-crash highs. In most cases, analysts said,  they are solid companies that enjoyed healthy returns.\nICN Biomedicals, a Costa Mesa medical instruments and chemicals company, led  the pack on a percentage basis. The stock rose 331%, starting the year at $3.25  and finishing at $14.\nFor the first 9 months of its current fiscal year, ICN Biomedicals has enjoyed  a 35% increase in earnings. Its third-quarter performance was even stronger,  with profits up 59%.\nGradco Corp., an Irvine manufacturer of office copier and printer products,  placed second, appreciating 126% for the year. Gradco stock, which began the  year at $5.875, closed at $13.25.\nIn the fiscal year ended March, 1988, Gradco reported net income of $4.1  million on sales of $90.9 million, and the company continued to post strong  numbers over the latter part of the year.\nDuring the past 12 months, most investors steered clear of small companies.  Many had been burned badly by the crash.\n\"A lot of the smaller Orange County companies are not very liquid, and they  just got hammered in the crash, as people fell over themselves to get out of  them,\" said Larry Selwitz, director of research at Cruttenden & Co., a  Newport Beach brokerage.\nMany investors who got back into the market in 1988 initially chose to buy  stocks in larger, more established companies.\nBut as the year wore on and many Orange County companies began to report strong  earnings, investors started funneling money into such companies as ICN  Biomedicals, Ropak and Gradco.\n\"The stock of some of these companies had become so oversold that people  realized these prices offered unusually good value,\" Selwitz said. \"It was an  opportunity for people to make a lot of money.\"\nMeanwhile, the county's biggest market losers generally reflected unspectacular  corporate performance.\nResdel Industries, a Newport Beach electronics firm, lost the most ground in  1988. Its stock began the year at $5.25 a share and crashed to $1.4375, a 73%  decline.\nThe company posted an $8.3-million loss for the year ended June 30 and  disclosed in October that it had laid off 130 people, or more than a third of  its work force. The firm's problems were attributed primarily to unsuccessful  efforts to expand through acquisitions.\nAnother bomb was Diceon Electronics, which began the year trading at $30.50 but  declined to $12.50 at year end, losing 59% of its value.\nDiceon had sales of $147 million and earned $9.8 million in the fiscal year  ended in September. But most of its profits were realized in the first 6 months  of the year, while the second half was a dud. Analysts are projecting that the  company will have flat earnings for the first half of 1989.\nAs a result, Diceon, which for several years has been one of Orange County's  top performing growth companies, was snubbed by analysts and investors.\nPreston Athey, a growth fund manager for T. Rowe Price in Baltimore, said he  continues to hold Diceon and several other Orange County stocks because of what  he believes are bright prospects for small growth companies in 1989.\nT. Rowe Price has about $1.3 billion invested in emerging growth funds. The  investment firm's Orange County holdings include National Education of Irvine,  Silicon Systems of Tustin and Archive Corp.\nAthey said a statistical indicator used by T. Rowe Price recently signaled that  many, small growth companies \"are grossly undervalued\" relative to historic  norms.\n\"If the past is any indication, 1989 is the year that these stocks will do very  well relative to the rest of the market,\" Athey said.\nHe said he is particularly bullish about small growth companies because many  economists and analysts are projecting that their earnings growth will outpace  larger companies in 1989.\nWINNERS AND LOSERS AMONG COUNTY STOCKS\nThe top 10 percentage gainers and losers in 1988 among stocks of Orange County  companies trading at $3 or more a share.\nGreatest Percentage Gains\n\n",
